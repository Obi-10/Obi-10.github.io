  <h1>The Effects of Meditation/Mindfulness</h1>

  <p>
    Hi, my name is Obsinet Fekadu. Welcome to my professional portfolio website. This site showcases my work in web development and my current data science project, 'The Effects of Meditation and Mindfulness.' <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">
    <br><br>Did you know that meditation can do more than help you relax? Research reveals that it can have a profound impact on mental health and overall well-being. For this project, I aimed to investigate the impact of regular meditation practice on emotional regulation, stress levels, and cognitive performance. <br>My research question is: <em>How does consistent meditation influence emotional control and mental state?</em> <br>Based on what I have discovered so far, my hypothesis is that people who meditate consistently experience reduced anxiety, greater emotional stability, and measurable changes in brain activity and behavior. <br>The dataset I am using compiles findings from multiple scientific studies on meditation’s effects across areas like cognitive function, emotional health, and social awareness. In this project, I focus on the psychological and emotional benefits, such as reduced anxiety, improved concentration, and increased empathy. My goal is to identify which effects have the strongest evidence and how they compare across categories. <br>Later, I will present these insights through clear visualizations, including charts and infographics, so anyone can quickly understand the impact of meditation on mental health.</span>
