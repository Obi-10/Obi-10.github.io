  <h1>The Effects of Meditation/Mindfulness</h1>
  <p>
    Hi, my name is Obsinet Fekadu. Welcome to my professional portfolio website. This site showcases my work in web
    development and my current data science project, 'The Effects of Meditation and Mindfulness.'<span
      id="dots">...</span><span id="more">
      <br><br>Did you know that meditation can do more than help you relax? Did you know that meditation can do more
      than help you relax? Many studies suggest that it can affect things like focus, stress, emotions, and overall
      well-being. <br>
      For this project, I looked at research findings that compare how strong the scientific evidence is for different
      benefits of meditation. Instead of measuring exact outcomes, the data focuses on how well each benefit is
      supported by research.
      <br>My research question is: <em>Which effects of meditation are most strongly supported by scientific
        evidence?</em>
      <br>Based on the data, my hypothesis is that meditation has stronger evidence for benefits like attention,
      emotional regulation, and stress reduction, while other claimed effects have weaker or mixed support.
      <br>TThe dataset I am using compiles findings from multiple scientific studies and ranks the strength of evidence
      for different meditation benefits on a scale from 0 (no evidence) to 4 (strong evidence). These benefits are
      grouped into categories such as cognitive, emotional, mental health, and physical effects. My goal is to compare
      these categories and identify where meditation appears to have the most reliable support.
      <br>To present these findings clearly, I use data visualizations, including a chart that shows how evidence
      strength varies across different meditation benefits so anyone can quickly understand the benefits of
      meditation.</span>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>Meditation is an ancient practice that has gained significant attention in modern psychology and neuroscience. It
      generally
      involves focusing the mind on a particular object, thought, or activity to achieve a mentally clear and
      emotionally calm state. Today, meditation is often studied for its potential effects on stress, attention, and
      emotional well-being.</p>
    <p>Researchers have explored how meditation may affect the brain and body, and some studies suggest changes in areas
      related to attention, memory, and emotional response. For example, research has linked regular meditation to
      differences in brain regions associated with focus and stress regulation, although the strength of evidence varies
      depending on the effect being studied.</p>
    <p>Meditation has also been connected to possible physical health benefits, such as lower blood pressure and
      improved sleep. While not all claims are supported equally, the growing body of research suggests that meditation
      may be a useful tool for improving certain aspects of mental and physical health when practiced consistently.</p>

    <h2>Meditation Data Analysis</h2>
    <p>This chart shows how strong the scientific evidence is for different benefits of meditation and mindfulness. Each
      bar represents one benefit, and the height shows the evidence strength on a scale from 0 to 4. Hovering over the
      bars also displays the evidence strength.</p>
